# Anduril

Anduril is a software suite for managing people, organizations, and technology in an educational setting. It is currently being developed for Montgomery Blair High School, but will be compatible with any academic network. Currently, we're focusing on the following features:

- Student, teacher, counselor, and staff management
- Mediated access to schedules based on school policy
- Club and organization management, mailing lists, and news boards
- Administrator communication for subdomains and school websites
- Central authentication for external, school-related services

And, of course, a solid foundation for future development

Feel free to reach out to us if you either have any questions or concerns or wish to contribute. This project is developed and maintained by the Blair Sysops.
